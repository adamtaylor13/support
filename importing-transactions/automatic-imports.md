# Automatic Imports

## Support for international banks

We'd love to integrate with international banks for automatic imports, but unfortunately we're running into blockers due to data privacy laws as we're a Canadian-based company. 

Our highest priority right now is connecting to European and Australian banks for automatic imports. We're actively working with a number of data providers and waiting patiently for them to work with local regulators and hopefully pave the way for us one day to support our international users with automatic imports.
