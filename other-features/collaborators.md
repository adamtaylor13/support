# Collaborators

Collaborate on a budget with your partner on Lunch Money! When you collaborate on a budget, you all have your own account and login, but you will share the same budget. That means you’ll be managing the same budget with the same accounts and assets and other settings. You’ll also be able to see who linked which account or who added which transaction.

You can collaborate with any number of people on a budget. The price you pay is per budget, not per person.

To invite someone to collaborate on a budget, go to _Setup_ and then _Settings_. Under the _Collaborators_ card, enter their email address to send them an invite link.
