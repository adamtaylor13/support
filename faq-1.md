## How do I delete my account?

There are a few ways to initiate the complete deletion of your account and all its data from our servers.

First, there is a cancellation flow from the Billing details under the Settings page. 

Second, all accounts that are 5 days past their trial expiration dates which do not have any billing information associated will automatically be purged.

Lastly, you can email us directly at support@lunchmoney.app and we'll delete your account within 24 hours.
