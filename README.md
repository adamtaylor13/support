# Getting Started

Welcome to the Lunch Money knowledge base! 

Please note, this is very much a work in progress. We will be adding more to these docs in the coming weeks. The goal is to have a complete and comprehensive guide to all aspects of Lunch Money for both current and prospective users to understand our system.

Want to contribute to the docs? Feel free to open a pull request against [lunch-money/support](https://github.com/lunch-money/support) on Github.

If you have any feedback on this knowledge base, please use the built-in feedback system or email us directly at [support@lunchmoney.app](mailto:support@lunchmoney.app)
