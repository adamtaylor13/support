# Tags

Tags are a great way to further organize your transactions. Tags are much more flexible to use than categories as there aren't so many other items associated and dependent on a transaction's tag.

A transaction can have any number of tags, from 0 to as many as possible before it looks wonky in the UI.

## What can you do with tags?

You can set the color scheme for any tag from the [Tags](https://my.lunchmoney.app/tags) page.

You can generate a report or charts based on tags from the [Analyze](https://my.lunchmoney.app/analyze) page.

You can break down your spending by tag, or filter transactions by tag from the [Transactions](https://my.lunchmoney.app/transactions) page.
