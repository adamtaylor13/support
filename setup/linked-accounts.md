# Accounts

## My partner and I have joint accounts and they are showing up twice with duplicate transactions. How do I handle this?

Our account removal flow can help with this!

Get started with this button in the details pane of the duplicate account you'd like to remove:

You'll be asked if you want to remove all accounts associated with the bank or just one account.

After that you'll have the option to keep and transfer all existing transactions or remove them all.
