# FAQ

## Are there plans for a mobile app?

We don't currently have concrete development plans for a mobile app but rest assured we will have a mobile solution one day. 

Lunch Money is maintained by a one-woman team, and right now, we're focused on rounding out the product through improvements and new features based on user feedback. Our current strength is our speed of development and iteration. Once we start supporting more than one platform, development will be slowed down. Therefore, it's imperative that we focus mainly on improving the product so that when we do eventually support a mobile app, we can be sure we're creating a mobile app based on a fully fleshed-out product.

We also understand that a mobile app is important to our users! It is one of our most highly-requested features. For full transparency, a mobile app roll out will likely start with a companion app for inputting cash transactions is the first priority and then support for reviewing transactions.

As an alternative, we have a [developer API ](https://developers.lunchmoney.app)which you can use to create your own companion app in the meantime!

Finally, we're committed to maintaining high quality and usability levels for all the platforms we will eventually support.

## How do I delete my account?

There are a few ways to initiate the complete deletion of your account and all its data from our servers.

First, there is a cancellation flow from the [Billing](https://my.lunchmoney.app/billing) page. 

Second, all accounts that are 5 days past their trial expiration dates which do not have any billing information associated will automatically be purged.

Lastly, you can email us directly at support@lunchmoney.app and we'll delete your account within 24 hours.
